a small space shooter, possible entry for February 1GAM

Gameplay
========

Player pilots a spaceship of sorts, viewed top-down, flying in a vertical line (upwards).
The player can accellerate, decelerate and move left/right. The ship's primary weapon is a fast-firing low-powered projectile gun on the front of the ship.

Enemies will come down from the top of the screen and travel in the opposite direction. Enemies will come in different sizes and abilities, some with shields and/or weapons of their own.

Waves
=====

Enemies are arranged in attack waves. These waves are predetermined, and must be beaten in the same order to advance in the game.
Ideally, 100 waves should be available with a "big" boss every 15 waves or so.

Survival Mode
=============

Alternatively, the player may choose to play in "survival mode", no fixed wave patterns here. Enemies will come in random positions, and keep coming until the player dies.

* Homing missile. Seeks nearest enemy.
* Double-barrel gun. Doubles 'stock' weapons fire

* Rockets. High damage, slow firing rockets.
